# **Visualization and Analysis of International Football Results (1872-2024)** ⚽📊  
_A project to bring the beautiful game to life through data visualization and analysis!_  

---

## **Overview**  
This repository contains code and analytical documents focused on the visualization and analysis of international football results spanning from 1872 to 2024, using a dataset sourced from Kaggle.  

For data visualization, two MVP Python libraries—**Matplotlib** and **Plotly**—have been utilized. Most visualizations are created using Matplotlib (because who doesn’t love classic elegance?), while Plotly steps in to add its interactive flair. Think of them as Messi and Ronaldo—different styles, but equally amazing! 😎

## **Introduction to Matplotlib** 🎨  

Matplotlib is like the Swiss Army knife of data visualization. Whether you need a simple line plot or a complex 3D chart, Matplotlib’s got your back.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Versatility**: From bar charts to scatter plots, Matplotlib’s got it all.  
- **Customization**: You control the colors, fonts, and styles like a true coach strategizing for the World Cup.  
- **Interactivity**: Zoom, pan, or get a closer look—it’s like VAR but actually useful!  
- **Integration**: Teams up seamlessly with pandas, NumPy, and SciPy.  

### **Basic Usage**  
To use Matplotlib, just bring it into your squad with:  

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```  

#### **Example: Creating a Simple Line Plot**  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data
years = [2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020]
population = [6.1, 6.5, 6.9, 7.3, 7.8]

# Create a line plot
plt.plot(years, population)

# Add title and labels
plt.title("World Population Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Population (billions)")

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```  
This snippet is like a friendly midfielder—reliable and easy to understand.

## **Introduction to Plotly** 🌐  

If Matplotlib is the workhorse, Plotly is the showstopper. It’s all about interactivity and jaw-dropping visuals.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Interactivity**: Hover, zoom, and pan your way to data insights—it’s like a highlight reel for your analysis.  
- **Versatility**: From heatmaps to 3D plots, Plotly does it all with style.  
- **Integration**: Works great with pandas and NumPy—your dream team for data!  
- **Accessibility**: Share visualizations easily; they run in any browser, even on your phone during halftime.  

### **Basic Usage**  
To start using Plotly, call it up with:  

```python
import plotly.express as px
```  

#### **Example: Creating a Simple Line Plot**  
```python
import plotly.express as px

# Data
years = [2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020]
population = [6.1, 6.5, 6.9, 7.3, 7.8]

# Create a line plot
fig = px.line(x=years, y=population, title="World Population Over Time")
fig.update_layout(xaxis_title="Year", yaxis_title="Population (billions)")

# Show the plot
fig.show()
```  
Plotly’s interactive charm will make your data analysis feel like a goal celebration! 🎉

## **Introduction to pandas** 🐼  

Pandas is the unsung hero of this project—the tireless midfielder who connects everything seamlessly. It handles, cleans, and transforms data with unmatched efficiency.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Data Structures**: Provides `Series` and `DataFrame` for powerful and intuitive data manipulation.  
- **Data Manipulation**: Filters, groups, and merges data like a pro referee controlling the game.  
- **Handling Missing Data**: Fills gaps in your data like a super-sub saving the day.  
- **Integration**: Plays beautifully with NumPy and Matplotlib.  
- **I/O Operations**: Reads and writes data in various formats—think of it as the transfer window for your datasets.  

### **Basic Usage**  
To start using pandas, import it with:  

```python
import pandas as pd
```  

#### **Example: Creating a Simple DataFrame**  
```python
import pandas as pd

# Data
data = {
    'Year': [2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020],
    'Population (billions)': [6.1, 6.5, 6.9, 7.3, 7.8]
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the DataFrame
print(df)
```  
Pandas makes your data as organized as a well-planned free kick routine.
